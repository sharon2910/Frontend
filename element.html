            <h5>Indiranagar</h5>
            <p>Indiranagar was formed as a BDA layout in the late 1970s, and was named after the former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi.[2] In the beginning, the locality was primarily a suburb, dotted with large bungalows and independent houses, mostly owned by defence personnel and public sector employees.

                The Information Technology boom in Bengaluru in the late 1990s converted Indiranagar and its two arterial roads (100 Feet Road and Chinmaya Mission Hospital Road) into a semi-commercial area. Today, Indiranagar is an important residential and commercial hub of Bengaluru.[citation needed]</p>
